# Paid Job API Integration Guide

## Why Paid APIs?

The free APIs (RemoteOK, TheMuse, Arbeitnow) are limited:
- ❌ Same jobs repeated across searches
- ❌ Limited to tech/remote roles
- ❌ No variety for different job types (writing, customer service, etc.)

**Paid APIs solve this** by aggregating from ALL major job boards.

## Implementation Plan

```python
# Test with free tier first
# If it works well, upgrade to $10/mo
```

### Phase 2: Upgrade Based on Usage
- Monitor search volume
- Upgrade when approaching limit
- $10/mo = 1,000 searches = ~30 searches/day

### Phase 3: Optimize
- Cache popular searches
- Implement rate limiting
- Add search analytics

## Cost Analysis

### For 100 Users/Month:
- Average 10 searches per user = 1,000 searches
- **Cost: $10/mo with JSearch Basic**

### For 1,000 Users/Month:
- 10,000 searches
- **Cost: $50/mo with JSearch Pro**

### ROI:
- If you charge $5/user or have ads
- 100 users × $5 = $500/mo revenue
- $10 API cost = 2% of revenue
- **Very sustainable!**
